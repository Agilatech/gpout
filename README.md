##Node class module for GpOut Sensor

#####This class module should work on any Linux platform, and has been thoroughly tested on BBB

###Install

```
npm install @agilatech/gpout
```
OR
```
git clone https://github.com/Agilatech/gpout.git
```

###Usage
#####Load the module and create an instance
```
const driver = require('@agilatech/gpout');

// create an instance 
const gpout = new driver();
```
#####Get basic device info
```
const name = gpout.deviceName();  // returns string with name of device
const type = gpout.deviceType();  // returns string with type of device
const version = gpout.deviceVersion(); // returns this software version
const active = gpout.deviceActive(); // true if active, false if inactive
const numVals =  gpout.deviceNumValues(); // returns the number of paramters sensed
```
####Send command to device
This device understands three commands:
1. high : sets the gpio output to high (also thought of as 1 or true)
2. low : sets the gpio output to low (also thought of as 0 or false)
3. toggle : flips the gpio output to the opposite of the current condition

Two functions accept commands, one syncronous and the other asynchronous
1. sendCommandSync(command) : synchronously send the string command
2. sendCommand(command, callback) : asynchronously send the string command, with the callback fucntion receiving err, status upon completion. Status is a numerical result, 1=successfull command, 0=N/A command, -1=bad command.

```
gpout.sendCommandSync('high');

// or asynchronously
gpout.sendCommand('toggle', function(err, status) {
    if (err) {
            console.err(`Error! ${err}`);
        }
        else {
            console.log(`gpio output value now set to ${gpout.valueAtIndexSync(0)}`);
        }
    });
}
```

####Get parameter info and values
```
// given a parameter index, these return parameter info
const paramName0 = gpout.nameAtIndex(0);
const paramType0 = gpout.typeAtIndex(0);
const paramVal0  = gpout.valueAtIndexSync(0);
```
####Asynchronous value collection is also available
```
//valueAtIndex(index, callback)
gpout.valueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
    else {
        console.log(`Asynchronous call return: ${val}`);
    }
});
```
####Watch for value changes
```
// watchValueAtIndex(index, callback)
gpout.watchValueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
	if (!err) {
		console.log("Gpout value is now : " + val);
	}
});
```

###Operation Notes
This class module is a general purpose output driver.  It is intended to be a generic driver to simply operate
a GPIO.  It makes no assumptions about what real-world function the GPIO may be doing, whether controlling a
single LED or operating coolant valves on a nuclear power plant.  It is intended for use with the Agilatech VersaLink IIoT system, but has a simple and generic enough API to be used by most anything.

##Node class module for GPIO output driver

#####This class module should work on any Linux platform, and has been thoroughly tested on BBB

###Install

```
npm install @agilatech/gpout
```
OR
```
git clone https://github.com/Agilatech/gpout.git
```

###Usage
#####Load the module and create an instance
```
const driver = require('@agilatech/gpout');

// creation of an instance will throw an exception if unable to connect to given gpio
try {
    // gpio IS MANDATORY PARAMETER. Typically will be a pin number
    const gpout = new driver(gpio); 
}
catch {
    console.err("Failed to create gpout instance");
}
```
#####Get basic device info
```
const name = gpout.deviceName();  // returns string with name of device
const type = gpout.deviceType();  // returns string with type of device
const version = gpout.deviceVersion(); // returns this software version
const active = gpout.deviceActive(); // true if active, false if inactive
const numVals =  gpout.deviceNumValues(); // returns the number of paramters sensed
```
####Send command to device
This device accepts commands in order to switch the level state of the gpio. Use the sendCommand function in either its synchronous or asynchronous form, with the single required parameter describing the desired action.
The command parameter may take one of three forms:
1. high : sets the gpio output to high (also thought of as 1 or true)
2. low : sets the gpio output to low (also thought of as 0 or false)
3. toggle : flips the gpio output to the opposite of the current condition

Two functions accept commands, one syncronous and the other asynchronous
1. sendCommandSync(command) : synchronously send the string command
2. sendCommand(command, callback) : asynchronously send the command string, with the callback fucntion receiving err, status upon completion. 

```
gpout.sendCommandSync('high');

// or asynchronously sendCommand(cmd, callback)
gpout.sendCommand('toggle', function(err, status) {
    if (err) {
            console.err(`Error! ${err}`);
        }
        else {
            console.log(`gpio output value now set to ${gpout.valueAtIndexSync(0)}`);
        }
    });
}

The return value is a numerical result, 1=successfull command, 0=N/A command, -1=bad command. The asynchronous version returns this result in the status parameter of the callback.
```

####Get parameter info and values
```
// given a parameter index, these return parameter info
const paramName0 = gpout.nameAtIndex(0);
const paramType0 = gpout.typeAtIndex(0);
const paramVal0  = gpout.valueAtIndexSync(0);
```
####Asynchronous value collection is also available
```
//valueAtIndex(index, callback)
gpout.valueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
    else {
        console.log(`Asynchronous call return: ${val}`);
    }
});
```
####Watch for value changes
```
// watchValueAtIndex(index, callback)
gpout.watchValueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
	if (!err) {
		console.log("Gpout value is now : " + val);
	}
});
```

###Operation Notes
This class module is a general purpose output driver.  It is intended to be a generic driver to simply operate
a single GPIO.  It makes no assumptions about what real-world function the GPIO may be doing, whether controlling a
small LED or operating coolant valves on a nuclear power plant.  It is intended for use with the Agilatech VersaLink IIoT system, but has a simple and generic enough API to be used by most anything.
